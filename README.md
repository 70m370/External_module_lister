# External_module_lister
Made with Visual Studio 2022 - comumnity.
Compiled with Multi-byte Character Set

The Project idea is to create a windows application that will analyse the memory modules loaded by other application at run time.

I made this project to get more knowledge about memory in windows and use/study the windows API.
